36537,R3ID037466,2021-06-09T09:47:17Z,NA,NA,NA,i am comfortable with its safety and effectiveness.  I have already gotten the vaccine
33887,R3ID036001,2021-04-14T11:44:49Z,NA,NA,NA,I'm not sure
41985,R3ID039474,2021-07-07T08:41:28Z,NA,NA,NA,Want to see more research on children first bc my son has a history of Kawasaki disease so we are concerned about vaccine reactions
38717,R3ID038389,2021-10-14T21:10:07Z,NA,NA,NA,I feel like it is safe and at least effective enough that it?s worth having. So I got it.
40041,R3ID038799,2021-10-16T08:38:13Z,NA,NA,NA,Already got both
34002,R3ID036048,2021-03-17T18:15:14Z,NA,NA,NA,I have received the Johnson and Johnson vaccine. I trust it?s safety and hope it proves effective in the long term
41615,R3ID039317,2021-09-16T09:04:37Z,NA,NA,NA,My husband and I got vaccinated at our first oppotunity
29170,R3ID033620,2021-07-07T08:39:20Z,NA,NA,NA,"I got it, plan to vaccinate my kids ASAP"
36712,R3ID037551,2021-07-07T13:28:05Z,NA,NA,NA,I believe there safe
38126,R3ID038164,2021-12-10T20:31:43Z,NA,NA,NA,"I think the vaccine is safe, I have been vaccinated before."
43080,R3ID039897,2021-06-09T13:30:22Z,NA,NA,NA,I think it?s safe and already got it.
25212,R3ID029751,2021-07-09T08:05:11Z,NA,NA,NA,I'm all for it. My husband and I have had ours and we're ready for our children to get theirs too.
30309,R3ID034169,2021-12-09T10:02:31Z,NA,NA,NA,"I have already received it. I feel it will help slow the spread, but if enough do not get vaccinated in enough time, it will continue to mutate and be less effective."
43777,R3ID040282,2021-12-10T14:20:27Z,NA,NA,NA,I think it should be a personal choice if someone wants to receive it or not.  I am undecided on the vaccine.
40774,R3ID039018,2021-12-08T12:40:30Z,NA,NA,NA,"Because the lines between public health, politics, and business have been blurred as a result of this pandemic, I have a difficult time fully trusting the Covid-19 vaccine in terms of its safety and effectiveness. I do not care for the propaganda the media has been using to push the vaccine and it makes me question the true motives behind why the vaccine is being pushed in the way that it is. Although the ""science"" that is behind the vaccine today may be showing that it is safe and effective, it could potentially be ""science"" in the future that shows unforeseen long term effects or even ineffectiveness. I was vaccinated simply because I was required to be for work. With that say, I am absolutely opposed to any form of vaccine mandate and it is very likely that I would still be unvaccinated today had it not be required. I have not seen any evidence that the vaccine is effective in preventing someone from contracting Covid-19. Rather, I look at it as a means of protecting oneself from a severe and potentially fatal form of the virus. However, the survival rate for the virus is already over 99%. As a healthy adult with no underlying health issues, I do not see an overwhelming need for the vaccine. You can still spread Covid-19 even when vaccinated so I am not buying into the argument that you are getting the vaccine to protect others. There are so many hypocritical arguments and overwhelming inconsistencies regarding Covid-19 protocols and restrictions that at this point it is hard to trust anything related to the pandemic. Look at the stands jam packed with people standing and sitting on top of each other at sporting events on television. These people are unmasked because they are outdoors and screaming and yelling while cheering on their team. The ""science"" says that because they are outdoors there is minimal risk of spreading Covid. You can't tell me that saliva isn't being released into the air and germs not spreading simply because they are outside. Yet children i"
25230,R3ID029797,2021-09-15T15:32:07Z,NA,NA,NA,I've already received it
27762,R3ID032551,2021-05-12T09:16:12Z,NA,NA,NA,I feel there isn?t enough research on the Covid 19 vaccine for me to feel safe or determined to get it. I have no plans on getting the shot.
39261,R3ID038564,2021-05-13T12:14:38Z,NA,NA,NA,I don't think they've had enough time to know the long term effects. I will not get it
31459,R3ID034823,2021-05-12T10:46:39Z,NA,NA,NA,I've already gotten it - I hope it's approved soon for children under 2
35444,R3ID036697,2021-11-10T16:21:06Z,NA,NA,NA,Good
24872,R3ID031277,2021-04-14T08:15:11Z,NA,NA,NA,"I'm concerned that it was rushed, and not as safe as  other vaccines. I am waiting to get the vaccine to see if there are long term effects."
39492,R3ID038628,2021-11-10T09:10:57Z,NA,NA,NA,Very good. I can't wait until the under 5 population can get it!

25806,R3ID030309,2021-11-12T11:09:55Z,NA,NA,NA,My husband and I are fully vaccinated. I believe the science on the safety is reliable and am confident as time goes by the effectiveness will be proven. I can?t wait for the vaccine to be available to younger kids/my kids to be old enough to get vaccinated.
36218,R3ID037281,2021-06-09T12:31:50Z,NA,NA,NA,I got it

45518,R3ID041329,2021-10-13T23:16:18Z,NA,NA,NA,I had one dose.  I think it works for most
32538,R3ID035324,2021-04-14T15:46:41Z,NA,NA,NA,We were nervous but have already gotten it for ourselves and will for our children when it's available because we feel the risks of covid are worse than the vaccine risks.
28403,R3ID033117,2021-03-19T09:17:55Z,NA,NA,NA,I don?t feel comfortable getting the shot or having my children get it. I don?t plan for anyone in my family to get it.
30581,R3ID034334,2021-11-11T16:30:19Z,NA,NA,NA,I plan to get my booster soon. I am so happy we have a vaccine. I believe it's safe and effective
31416,R3ID034802,2021-07-07T13:54:37Z,NA,NA,NA,"I believe the COVID vaccine is safe & effective. Any potential risks are dwarfed by the enormous threat to personal & public health that COVID poses. I got the vaccine as soon as I was eligible, and I will have my children do the same."
43248,R3ID039971,2021-06-09T19:47:03Z,NA,NA,NA,I am confident in the science and medicine behind the vaccine. My husband and I have already gotten it.
36231,R3ID037293,2021-05-12T10:16:52Z,NA,NA,NA,I don?t feel it?s safe and won?t be getting one
33702,R3ID035923,2021-12-09T13:28:40Z,NA,NA,NA,Im not 100 that it is safe or effective. I did get the vaccination for protection.
28118,R3ID032851,2021-06-10T09:14:04Z,NA,NA,NA,I feel it's safe but im on the fence to get it due to breastfeeding

26305,R3ID030965,2021-07-08T15:56:48Z,NA,NA,NA,I and my husband have both got them. We generally are very pro-vaccine. Our kids will get Covid vaccines when they are able.
43974,R3ID040389,2021-10-13T19:29:49Z,NA,NA,NA,Forced to get it because I work for the VA? would not have otherwise. My own antibodies are more efficient in fighting the virus.
28396,R3ID033112,2021-04-15T14:20:30Z,NA,NA,NA,I have received 2 doses of Moderna.
32155,R3ID035608,2021-04-15T14:38:39Z,NA,NA,NA,Not good

28116,R3ID032845,2021-10-13T12:28:44Z,NA,NA,NA,Unsure about safety.  Not convinced that it works.  Not likely to get it
28696,R3ID033407,2021-12-08T19:56:26Z,NA,NA,NA,Its good to get a vaccine
40520,R3ID038943,2021-12-10T09:17:18Z,NA,NA,NA,"My husband and I have already received the vaccine, and I have signed my 6 year old son up to receive as well"

38653,R3ID038368,2021-09-15T18:09:24Z,NA,NA,NA,Given how short the study period has been for the vaccine thus far I am concerned about long term side affects that could start being seen in the future.  I have several friends who have gotten the vaccine and developed rapid growths in benign tumors (one of which died within 2 weeks of the vaccine) and I have that same diagnosis which makes me wary.
26373,R3ID031008,2021-09-16T00:54:37Z,NA,NA,NA,I got it but not sure if it?s safety

I'm glad I got vaccinated because our 15 month old is still nursing and I hope she'll benefit. I wish I could get our five year old vaccinated."
24695,R3ID02838,2021-05-13T12:25:45Z,NA,NA,NA,"I feel fine about it, and have had one shot of the series."

30083,R3ID034076,2021-09-16T20:40:12Z,NA,NA,NA,I'm comfortable with the safety. The numbers don't lie as far as effectiveness. I have been fully vaccinated since April 2021.

23630,R3ID00444,2021-11-14T09:40:54Z,NA,NA,NA,"We will not be getting it. There is not enough information on the long term effects for me to feel comfortable taking it. Now that its becoming available for 5-11 years of age, I'm concerned it may become required for school and that's very upsetting to me. I don't want to be forced to give my child something i don't feel comfortable with"
