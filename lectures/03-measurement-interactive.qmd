## Last time

Validity (4 types)

-   Construct
-   Statistical Conclusion
-   Internal
-   External

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Today

More about construct validity and its role in scale development.

-   BUT before we talk about construct validity, we must first discuss conceptual clarity.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Conceptual clarity ([Bringmann, Elmer, & Eronen, 2022](../readings/bringmann_etal_2022.pdf))

-   Identifying and characterizing the concept of study
    -   This is independent of measurement and must happen before measurement
-   Why is conceptual clarity important?

::: notes
-   Especially with concepts from everyday life, there are often many ways to define the concept. (Bringmann and co describe friendship, but think of others)
    -   Must have consistency when evaluating a concept in a systematic way (e.g., science)
-   Importantly, statistics cannot provide evidence for conceptual clarity
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## How to evaluate and improve conceptual clarity

-   Iterate, iterate, iterate
-   Explicitly discuss in empirical (and non-empirical) work
-   Justify the use of measures for concept
-   Use multiple measures (multiverse analysis)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## How to evaluate and improve conceptual clarity

-   Conduct studies on concepts before studying how they relate to over variables, change over time, can be manipulated, etc.
-   Use qualitative methods to understand how participants interpret measures.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Once a concept has been clarified, the next step is to measure it.

It wasn't assigned, but please read a great article by [Len Simms](https://uopsych.github.io/psy611/readings/Simms_2008.pdf)[^1]. This article focuses on the measurement using **survey** methods, but this logic extends to any measurement in which you aggregate multiple responses or scores.

I'm going to use this article as a template for developing a new scale with you.

## Phases of scale development

:::: {.column width="25%"}

Let's develop a scale for "academic stress."

What are some specific aspects of academic stress?

**Write the item pool**

-   Items should be relevant and representative
-   Seek to be over-inclusive

::: notes
...coursework pressure, deadlines, fear of failure, workload
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Guidelines for good items:

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Simple and straight forward
-   No double-barrels
-   Avoid slang
-   Phrase items generally
-   Phrase items about sensitive topics using matter-of-fact and nonperjorative language
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Choose response format carefully
    -   Dichotomous vs polytomous
    -   Number of options
    -   Response categories
    -   Phrasing of items should be consistent with response format

## Next steps:

* Take scale
* Discuss items
* Basic descriptives (mean and variance)
* Item-total correlations
* Alpha/Omega
* Factor analysis


------------------------------------------------------------------------

Takeaways:
* Be able to perform psychometric analysis from memory. 
* (Kidding)
* Scale development takes time, thought, iteration, and data.
